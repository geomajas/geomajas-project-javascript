	GWT Logic: collapse-all-properties and sso linker only works together with style=PRETTY or DETAILED.
	We need a single javascript file, so that's what we do now. Only drawback is that the file is bigger
	(however zipped it has the same size).

	Alternative is to use the xsiframe linker, this generates two javascript files (nocache.js and <MD5>.cache.js)
